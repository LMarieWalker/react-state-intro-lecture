## Learning Goals
* Utilize `this.setState` with event handlers to manage component state 
* Recognize when state should be "lifted up"
* Manage state updates through props

## Topics
* Anatomy of a class-based component 
* Why we don't have to bind stuff in constructor with Create-React-App: https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class 
* Events/event handlers - https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events 
* Using react devtools to track state and props updates 


## Branches
* Simplest setState possible: `button-click`
* Using prevState when setting state: `button-click-with-counter`
* Lifting state up/sharing state between child components: `button-counter-lifting-state`
* Setting state with arrays: `button-counter-array`
